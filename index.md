# Dave Herbert -- Freelance Magento Developer
## Web Developer and Software Engineer based in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

{% include portrait.html %}

An experienced **freelance web developer** based in Leeds, specialising in the **Magento eCommerce platform**. Serving the areas around Leeds, Harrogate, York, and across the UK. I am both a Certified Magento Developer and Zend Certified Engineer.

A developer with PHP since 2000, and with Magento since 2010, I have been freelancing since 2011. I have extensive experience of the development and customisation of Magento, and the creation of bespoke extensions.

I have worked on a wide range of development projects for clients ranging from small businesses and sole traders, to large global enterprises requiring complex integration projects.

Although I specialise in **Magento development**, I have also worked with **WordPress** and bespoke implementations based on other PHP frameworks. If you have a project you'd like to discuss, please [send me an email](mailto:{{site.email | encode_email}}).
